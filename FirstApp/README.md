# Details

This was easy challenge for me because I was doing something similar in the past.

## Write Up:

Although at first it seemed like it was going to be too much of a challenge, I managed to remember doing a similar challenge recently. So here experience played an essential role!
So when we open this site we see a message that says: You are not logged in. 

As we don't have any pages but just a message, I tried to get to the flag via `IP / flag.txt` and it wrote me the following message!

After that we get a message
```Cannot GET / flag.txt```

 Shortly after thinking I tried to dig through google but I came back, looked at the message and it just occurred to me why not try `get_flag` or `get_file`

 After I typed the get flag and I got the next message which annoyed me a bit hahah.

 After that, I couldn't do anything because every time I got the message `SRYSLYYYYY`. I started digging a little deeper and found that there was also a page `/login`. I came looking for cooper and I found gold :3.

 Shortly after that, I immediately knew what I needed to do, that is, I had to curl into that page with a cookie session and a certain payload. I tried various payloads and in the end it turned out to be this:
```curl --cookie 'session=18324dc6ed5911d0a18cc47916003a7d' "http://207.180.200.166:3000/get_url?url=http://localhost:3000/get_file?file=flag.txt```

And bum We GOT THE FLAG!!!
